// AOB Resolver
//
// The loader only lets a plugin pattern scan from the OnPluginLoadHooks event,
// which runs after GetPluginInfo and before PluginInit. IPluginHookScanner
// rejects any call made outside that window, so every pattern in
// aob_patterns.h is resolved here, once, and the resulting addresses are
// stashed in ResolvedAddresses for the feature modules to install from.
//
// self->hooks is null for the duration of the event on purpose: a plugin that
// misses a required pattern is unloaded, so nothing may be detoured until
// PluginInit. Resolve here, install there.
//
// Every pattern is resolved as OPTIONAL, but that word only decides how the
// failure line reads. The loader refuses a plugin that missed anything at all —
// required or optional, one is enough — skips PluginInit and frees the DLL, so a
// pattern that stops matching after a game update takes the whole menu down, not
// just the cheat behind it. The per-address null checks in the feature modules
// still earn their keep (a hook can fail to install, and a hot reload can land
// mid-session), but a miss in the loader's startup failure report is a
// build-breaking bug to fix here, not something the menu degrades around.
//
// The Deconstruct Windows During Waves patterns are the one exception: they
// back an opt-in toggle, so they are scanned without the loader recording
// anything, and a miss turns that toggle off instead of refusing the plugin.
