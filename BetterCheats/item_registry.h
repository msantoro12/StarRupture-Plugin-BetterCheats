// Shared item-type asset-registry plumbing. Both the Item Spawner
// (player_items.cpp) and the Inventory panel's stack-size controls
// (player_inventory.cpp, gss.17) need "every UAuItemBlueprint asset type,
// resolved down to its UAuItemDataBase CDO" -- the resolution path (a
// ProcessEvent call against IAssetRegistry, then a force-load + generated-
// class chase mirroring the game's own UCrUW_CheatItemsTab::
// DebugGatherAllItems) is fragile and version-specific enough that it should
// exist exactly once rather than as two independent copies that could drift.
//
// Game-thread only, same constraint as every other UObject/ProcessEvent call
// in this codebase -- callers are responsible for getting here via
// PostToGameThread (see player_items.cpp/player_inventory.cpp for the
// request/adopt pattern each panel wraps this in).
