// Shared by player_weapons.cpp and player_movement.cpp: neither file can set a
// GAS attribute's BaseValue (no reflected setter -- see the weapon/movement
// audits), so a cheat slider has to observe whatever the ability system
// aggregated (weapon attachments, LEMs) and layer its own change on top of
// CurrentValue instead of stomping it. Operates on a plain `float&` rather
// than `FGameplayAttributeData&` -- CurrentValue is the only member either
// file ever touches -- so the same class also composes onto a plain UObject
// property (e.g. a weapon data asset's BaseMagazine.Value) that has no GAS
// attribute wrapping it at all.
